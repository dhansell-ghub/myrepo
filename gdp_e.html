<ol>
<li>Understand the expenditure approach of GDP</li>
<li>How to map these concepts to ABS national accounts time series</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: there is a corresponding module that demonstrates how to download ABS data directly in R-Studio and make the charts presented here.</p>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Overview</h2></hgroup><article  id="overview">

<ul>
<li>GDP = Gross Domestic Product

<ul>
<li><strong>Gross</strong> = includes depreciation of capital</li>
<li><strong>Domestic</strong> = confined to a production boundary</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong> = what is produced</li>
</ul></li>
<li>System of National Accounts (SNA) defines GDP three ways

<ul>
<li><strong>Expenditure</strong>: Consumption + Investment + Govt Purchases + Exports – Imports</li>
<li><strong>Income</strong>: Compensation of Employees (CoE) + Gross Operating Surplus (GOS)</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong>: Output less intermediate Expenses (value-added).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In other words, we spend our income on what we produce.</li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Overview</h2></hgroup><article  id="overview-1">

<p>This module focusses on the expenditure approach or GDP(E).</p>

<p>We divide the module into two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Concepts<br/></li>
<li>Measurement.</li>
</ol>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>GDP (E) - Concepts</h2></hgroup><article  id="gdp-e---concepts">

<p>Expenditure approach to GDP is based on the framework: \[
\begin{aligned}
GDP = \text{Consumption}   \\
+ \text{ Investment} \\
+ \text{ Govt purchases of goods and services} \\
+ \text{ Exports} \\
- \text{ Imports} 
\end{aligned}
\] This is often abbreviated as \(GDP = C + I + G + X - M\)</p>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>GDP (E) - Concepts</h2></hgroup><article  id="gdp-e---concepts-1">

<ul>
<li><strong>Consumption</strong> means the good or service is used within the period of observation. Thus expenditure is final.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong> implies the good or service (incl. capitalized wages) is funneled into an asset that lasts for a while so it makes things/provides services in more than one period.

<ul>
<li>In other words, investment is a flow that creates a stock (capital).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Governments</strong> employ people, tax and spend, but households receive income to consume so we don’t count the wages of govt employees as govt expenditure (unless they’re transformed into capital, see above).

<ul>
<li>We only include government purchases and then separate these into final consumption (eg. stationery) or investment (eg. roads).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>GDP (E) - Concepts</h2></hgroup><article  id="gdp-e---concepts-2">

<ul>
<li><strong>Production boundary</strong>: The geographic area of concern. In this case, Australia and associated territories.

<ul>
<li>Note: the ABS national accounts also include state accounts, which are just subsets of the broader set.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exports</strong> are goods or services within the production boundary</li>
<li><strong>Imports</strong> are goods or services produced outside the production boundary.</li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class="segue dark nobackground level1"><hgroup class = 'auto-fadein'><h2>Measurement</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement">

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Measurement - Overview</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement---overview">

<ul>
<li>ABS publishes <a href='https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-system-national-accounts/latest-release' title=''>annual (5204)</a> and <a href='https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-national-accounts-national-income-expenditure-and-product/latest-release' title=''>quarterly (5206)</a> national accounts.</li>
<li>Quarterly estimates are often carried forward by projecting the movements in correlated series and are subject to more revision than annual estimates.</li>
<li>Annual estimates (apart from the most recent year) are balanced via the supply-use tables.

<ul>
<li>Main point: Once the level of GDP is finalized via balancing the statistical discrepancy item is zero. Supply-use tables start in 1994 so before this the statistical discrepancy is not zero.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hence here we focus on the annual estimates found in table 2 of catalogue 5204.</li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Measurement - Overview</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement---overview-1">

<ul>
<li>Table 2 contains chain volume estimates of expenditure.

<ul>
<li>Current price estimates for expenditure are published in the quarterly accounts (5206)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Table 2 contains 174 series. Many of these are subtotals so we can’t add up the rows to get the total.</li>
<li>More detailed breakdowns of these series are found in other tables of the 5204 publication.

<ul>
<li>For example, table 8 contains a detailed breakdown of household final consumption expenditure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fortunately many of these are not necessary to get a high-level of understanding. In fact we only need 8 columns and not all 8 are of equal importance.</li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Measurement - Consumption</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement---consumption">

<ul>
<li>The two main components of consumption expenditure are

<ul>
<li><strong>Household Consumption</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420655V</li>
<li>Official title: Households; Final Consumption Expenditure</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>General Government Consumption</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420654T</li>
<li>Official title: General Government; Final Consumption Expenditure</li>
<li>Encompasses all levels of Australian government.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note: The G in the formula on slide 3 is separated into consumption and investment in the national accounts.</li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Measurement - Investment</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement---investment">

<ul>
<li><strong>Investment</strong> in the SNA is referred to as <em>gross fixed capital formation</em>. The two main series are

<ul>
<li><strong>Private Investment</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420674A</li>
<li>Official title: Private; Gross Fixed Capital Formation</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Public Investment</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420683C</li>
<li>Official title: Public; Gross Fixed Capital Formation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Measurement - Exports and Imports</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement---exports-and-imports">

<ul>
<li><strong>Exports</strong> count towards GDP, while <strong>imports</strong> are subtracted because they weren’t produced within the Australian production boundary. The two main series are

<ul>
<li><strong>Exports</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420691C</li>
<li>Official title: Export of Goods and Services</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Imports</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420692F</li>
<li>Official title: Imports of Goods and Services</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Measurement - Inventories and Discrepancy</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement---inventories-and-discrepancy">

<ul>
<li><strong>Inventories</strong> can be negative or positive as goods or services produced in previous time periods can be run down (ie, negative) or added to in the current period (ie, positive)

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420689T</li>
<li>Official title: Change in inventories</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Statistical discrepancy</strong> refers to the difference in this account with the others. It disappears after the ABS conducts supply-use balancing, ie, it apportions the difference to either accounts and hence all measures of GDP become equal.

<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2420693J</li>
<li>Official title: Statistical Discrepancy (E)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Measurement - Recap</h2></hgroup><article  id="measurement---recap">

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
GDP (E) = \text{Household Consumption}   \\

<ul>
<li>GDP (E) is the sum of household and government final consumption, public and private investment, net exports, and inventories.</li>
<li>ABS publishes volume estimates of annual values in the Australian System of National Accounts (ASNA – cat no 5204)</li>
<li>While there are 174 columns in the relevant table (ie, no 2), there are only 8 relevant to the total and the largest component is household final consumption expenditure.</li>

<ul>
<li>Economic analysis is about the allocation of scare resources. So if we just use current prices, we’re not shedding light on the volume of resources consumed/produced.</li>
<li>Two options:

<ul>
<li><strong>Constant prices</strong>: Deflate all values via price index(es) which use a common base period. Often this is expressed as using the values of a particular year, such as $USD2015.</li>
<li><strong>Chain volumes</strong>: This involves estimating the quantities in each overlapping years in the same prices; that is, estimate the 2019 and 2020 values using 2019 prices or vice versa.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Chain volume estimates and non-additivity</h2></hgroup><article  id="chain-volume-estimates-and-non-additivity-1">

<ul>
<li>Chain volume measures value quantities by prices in a base period which is updated annually. That base period for national accounts is always the period or year prior to the current period.

<ul>
<li>So if you’re looking at the 2020 national accounts, the value for 2019 in chain volumes is equal to the 2019 current price value. And so on, if you’re looking at the 2030 national accounts, the value for 2029 in chain volumes is equal to the 2029 current price value.</li>
<li>The components of GDP only add up in the most recent periods. Hence the further we are away from the most recent period, the bigger the divergence between the sum of the parts and the whole.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</article></slide><slide class=""><hgroup><h2>Chain volume estimates and non-additivity</h2></hgroup><article  id="chain-volume-estimates-and-non-additivity-2">

<ul>
<li>In other words, updating the reference period means revisions to the <em>levels</em> of chain volume measures for all subsequent periods.</li>
<li>Hence the chain volume estimate for each year will change in each subsequent release but growth rates don’t.</li>
<li>So changing the reference period doesn’t change the growth rate. And that’s the whole point. We’re prioritising growth rates over levels (of GDP).</li>
