<h3 class="subtitle">Module 2: Gross Domestic Product (Income)</h3>
<h4 class="author">David Hansell</h4>

</div>


<div id="aims-of-the-module" class="section level2">
<h2>Aims of the module</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Understand the income approach of GDP</li>
<li>How to map these concepts to ABS national accounts time series</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: there is a corresponding module that demonstrates how to download ABS data directly in R-Studio and make the charts presented here.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>GDP = Gross Domestic Product
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross</strong> = includes depreciation of capital</li>
<li><strong>Domestic</strong> = confined to a production boundary</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong> = what is produced</li>
</ul></li>
<li>System of National Accounts (SNA) defines GDP three ways
<ul>
<li><strong>Expenditure</strong>: Consumption + Investment + Govt Purchases + Exports – Imports</li>
<li><strong>Income</strong>: Compensation of Employees (CoE) + Gross Operating Surplus (GOS)</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong>: Output less intermediate Expenses (value-added).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In other words, we spend our income on what we produce.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="overview-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This module focusses on the income approach or GDP(I).</p>
<p>We divide the module into two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Concepts<br />
</li>
<li>Measurement.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="concepts" class="section level1">
<h1>Concepts</h1>
<div id="gdp-i---concepts" class="section level2">
<h2>GDP (I) - Concepts</h2>
<p>Income approach to GDP is based on the framework: <span class="math display">\[
\small
\begin{aligned}
GDP = \text{Compensation of Employees (CoE)}   \\
+ \text{ Gross Operating Surplus (GOS)} \\
+ \text{ Gross Mixed Income (GMI)} \\
+ \text{ Taxes} \\
- \text{ Subsidies (on Production and Imports)} 
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\small
\left.
\begin{array}{l}
\text{CoE is returns to labour}\\
\text{GOS is returns to capital}\\
\text{GMI is combined labour and capital}
\end{array}
\right\}
=\text{ Income to Factors}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="gdp-i---concepts-1" class="section level2">
<h2>GDP (I) - Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compensation of Employees</strong> – includes wages and salaries paid to employees and employer social contributions.
<ul>
<li>Employer’s social contributions are paid by employers to employees (typically) in advance of the benefit being paid. These include payments for sickness, accidents, redundancy, retirement and superannuation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gross Operating Surplus</strong> is the surplus paid to owners of incorporated businesses. It includes profits, depreciation and obsolecence of capital. It’s often measured as a residual: ie, once we know CoE and the level of GDP, we can back-out GoS.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="gdp-i---concepts-2" class="section level2">
<h2>GDP (I) - Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Mixed Income</strong> is best thought of as CoE and GOS for unincorporated (and small) businesses.
<ul>
<li>For example, if a business owner doesn’t pay a wage to his/herself but receives “profits” from the business, this is a combination of the return to capital and labour, but the returns to factors of production (capital and labour) are combined.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Total Factor Income</strong> is the sum of Compensation of Employees, Gross Operating Surplus and Gross Mixed Income.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="gdp-i---concepts-3" class="section level2">
<h2>GDP (I) - Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxes less subsidies</strong> on production and imports – this item is necessary to convert GDP at basic prices – ie returns to the factors of production – into GDP at market prices.
<ul>
<li>Why? Because GDP(E) is measured in market prices, which include taxes and subsidies on the products consumed or transformed into capital.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="measurement" class="section level1">
<h1>Measurement</h1>
<div id="measurement---overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Measurement - Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>ABS publishes <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-system-national-accounts/latest-release">annual (5204)</a> and <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-national-accounts-national-income-expenditure-and-product/latest-release">quarterly (5206)</a> national accounts.</li>
<li>Quarterly estimates are often carried forward by projecting the movements in correlated series and are subject to more revision than annual estimates</li>
<li>Annual estimates (apart from the most recent year) are balanced via the supply-use tables.
<ul>
<li>Main point: Once the level of GDP is finalized the statistical discrepancy item is zero. Supply-use tables start in 1994 so before this the statistical discrepancy is not zero.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hence here we focus on the annual estimates found in table 6 of catalogue 5204.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="measurement---overview-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Measurement - Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Table 6 contains current price estimates of income.
<ul>
<li>Why current prices and not a volume measure?
<ul>
<li>No natural price index for GOS.</li>
<li>Wages can be deflated separately via Wage Price Index or GDP deflator.</li>
<li>Hours worked are also measured and that is a pure volume measure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compared to expenditure approach, there are not as many series in table 6.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="measurement---compensation-of-employees" class="section level2">
<h2>Measurement - Compensation of Employees</h2>
<ul>
<li>The two series that make up Compensation of Employees are
<ul>
<li><strong>Wages and Salaries</strong>: Series ID = A2421038F</li>
<li><strong>Employer Social Contributions</strong>: Series ID = A2421039J</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However these two series only start from the 1989-90 fiscal year.</li>
<li>Hence we use <strong>Compensation of Employees</strong> so we can look at longer term trends:
<ul>
<li>Series ID = A2421040T</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="measurement---gross-operating-surplus" class="section level2">
<h2>Measurement - Gross Operating Surplus</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross operating surplus</strong> (series ID = A2421313L ) consists of 5 main series
<ul>
<li>Private non-financial corporations (A2421041V)</li>
<li>Public non-financial corporations (A2421042W)</li>
<li>Financial corporations (A2421309W)</li>
<li>General government (A2421311J)</li>
<li>Dwellings owned by persons (A2421312K)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The most confusing of these is dwellings.
<ul>
<li>Main idea: Dwellings are capital and provide services (ie, shelter).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="measurement---gmi-and-taxessubsidies" class="section level2">
<h2>Measurement - GMI and Taxes/Subsidies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gross Mixed Income</strong> (series ID = A2421314R) is for unincorporated enterprises where it’s difficult to separate a return to capital and return to labour.
<ul>
<li>Example: A family operates a business as a trust that pays no official wages, but provides dividends to the members of the trust.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As discussed above, <strong>taxes less subsidies on production and imports</strong> (series ID = A2421316V) is needed to convert GDP at basic prices to market prices.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The income approach to GDP shows the returns to the factors of production: labour and capital.
<ul>
<li>Note: taxes less subsidies on production and imports is needed to ensure consistency of GDP(I) and the other measures of GDP</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The largest share of GDP(I) is compensation of employees.</li>
<li>The share of gross operating surplus has risen over time, largely due to the fall in gross mixed income.
<ul>
<li>This doesn’t necessarily reflect a rise in corporate profit, but a change in business structures away from unincorporated business to incorporated entities.</li>
</ul></li>
